          At Be More Free, use the Neutral Zone exclusively because traditional approaches 
          weren't working. For decades, people have been told that healing takes years, that they need 
          expert guidance, and that someone else knows better than they do about their own experience.

            In Neutral Zone sessions at Be More Free, the facilitator has no altitude over you. 
            They don't evaluate, interpret, or direct. Everything you say is taken 
            as truth for that session. You explore what YOU want to explore.
