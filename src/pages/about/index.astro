        What is Neutral Zone?
      </h1>
      <p class="text-xl text-center text-gray-700 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
        A radically different approach where you examine your own material 
        in a completely neutral space—without evaluation, interpretation, 
        or someone else's agenda.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Not Therapy. Not Coaching. Something Else Entirely.</h2>
        
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
          For decades, people have been told that healing takes years, that they need 
          expert guidance, and that someone else knows better than they do about their 
          own experience. The Neutral Zone takes a completely different approach.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Problem with Traditional Approaches</h3>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Whether it's therapy, coaching, or self-help, most approaches share common problems:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li>Someone else sets the agenda and decides what's important</li>
          <li>Your experience gets interpreted through their frameworks</li>
          <li>You're taught to manage symptoms instead of examining what's actually there</li>
          <li>Progress is measured by their standards, not yours</li>
          <li>Years go by with minimal real change</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Neutral Zone Difference</h3>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          In Neutral Zone sessions, the practitioner has no altitude over you. 
          They don't evaluate, interpret, or direct. Everything you say is taken 
          as truth for that session. You explore what YOU want to explore.
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-8">
          This creates a genuinely neutral space where your own wisdom can emerge—often 
          leading to insights and changes that years of traditional approaches couldn't achieve.
        </p>

        <div class="bg-gray-50 p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
          <ul class="space-y-4">
            <li class="flex items-start">

            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-blue-600 mr-3">•</span>
              <span>The practitioner creates a neutral space without adding their own material</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-blue-600 mr-3">•</span>
              <span>You explore at your own pace, in your own way</span>

            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-blue-600 mr-3">•</span>
              <span>Your discoveries and choices are entirely your own</span>
            </li>
            <li class="flex items-start">
              <span class="text-blue-600 mr-3">•</span>
              <span>No homework, no frameworks, no "right" way to do it</span>

        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Neutral Zone works especially well for people who:
        </p>
        
        <ul class="space-y-3 mb-8">
          <li>Are tired of being told what their experience "really" means</li>
          <li>Have tried multiple approaches without lasting results</li>
          <li>Want to examine difficult material without judgment</li>
          <li>Trust their own wisdom when given actual space</li>
          <li>Are ready to stop managing symptoms and look at what's there</li>
        </ul>

          <p class="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Important Note:</p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Neutral Zone is not therapy, counseling, or medical treatment. 
            It's not a replacement for medical care if you need it. 
            It's simply a space to examine your own material without interference.
